## Java Learning DAY1
Today I installed JDK and make my environment ready. Then I wrote "Hello, World!" code by java successfully! I think it will be a good start to my jave learning days. I will keep going and do my best to record my step in English. I swear it will be benefit for both my java learning and English learning.

## Java Learning DAY2
Yesterday I was busy in other things so I stopped my learning a day, it was not a big deal. Just now I started to learn what the 48 keywords are and how to use them. Unfortunately, when I wanted to put them in a folder, there were something wrong with it. Because I am using vscode but not the IDEA maybe, there are few guide to teach me how to code java by vscode. Later today I will try again. Now it is 1:19PM and I gotta sleep for a while.
