## Java Learning DAY1
Today I installed JDK and make my environment ready. Then I wrote "Hello, World!" code by java successfully! I think it will be a good start to my jave learning days. I will keep going and do my best to record my step in English. I swear it will be benefit for both my java learning and English learning.
